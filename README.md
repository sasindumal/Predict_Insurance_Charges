# Predicting Insurance Charges - Machine Learning Project 💻

## Overview 🧐
In this project, I step into the role of a Data Scientist at a health insurance company, tasked with predicting insurance charges based on various client attributes such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, and other health-related factors. The goal is to develop a predictive model that helps the insurance company more accurately estimate charges, manage risks, and provide personalized pricing strategies to clients. 📊💡

## Dataset 📋
The dataset used for this project contains the following attributes:
- **Age**: The age of the individual.
- **Sex**: The gender of the individual (Male/Female).
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index of the individual.
- **Children**: The number of children/dependents covered by the insurance.
- **Smoker**: Whether the individual is a smoker (Yes/No).
- **Region**: The region where the individual resides.
- **Charges**: The insurance charge (the target variable to predict).

## Project Steps 🚀

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing** 🔍:  
   - Load and clean the data.
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and correlations.

2. **Feature Engineering** 🛠️:  
   - Scale numerical features.
   - Encode categorical variables.

3. **Model Building** 🧠:  
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train models using **Linear Search** with Scikit-learn for optimized parameter tuning.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as MSE, and R².

4. **Model Tuning** 🔧:  
   - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance using techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search.

5. **Model Evaluation** 📈:  
   - Compare models based on evaluation metrics.
   - Choose the best-performing model for predicting insurance charges.
